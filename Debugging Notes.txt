If the transceiver does not start up correctly then please try the following. 


Log into the Pi using ssh the same way that you did to build the software. 

Type 'ps -ax' to get a list of the running programs. 

You should be able to find the three programs needed in the list. 
They will be called home/pi/Langstone/Lang_TX.py , home/pi/Langstone/Lang_RX.py  and  home/pi/Langstone/GUI

If the transceiver is not running then one of these will probably be missing. 

Make a note of the Process ID for either or both of the programs and then kill them using the command

'kill -9 nnn'     where nnn is the process ID noted above.

Repeat this to kill both programs.

Try ps -ax again to make sure both programs have been killed

try starting the GNURadio Rx Program manually
 
cd ~/Langstone
python Lang_RX.py &

You should see a couple of INFO lines about the Audio Source and Audio Sync and a line  len(audio_taps) = 213
The LED on your USB Audio Dongle should start flashing 

Any other error messages should give a clue as to what is wrong. 

Then Start the Tx Program.
python Lang_TX.py &

If this works then start the GUI with the command

./GUI &

The LCD Screen should come to life and the transceiver should be working.

You should not see any error messages. 

ps -ax   again should now show both programs running.  

You may see occasional aU characters printed on your ssh screen. This is normal and indicates an occasional audio overrun condition. 
This seems to be a bug in GNU radio on the Pi and does not affect operation if they are only happening occasionally.
